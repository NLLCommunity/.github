Norwegian Language Learning (NLL) is a community of people who support each other in learning and helping others learn the Norwegian language. We operate a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mBsKjx7) that welcomes everyone, whether Norwegian is their native language or they are just beginning their language learning journey.

This GitHub organization is a place for us to collaborate on projects that power different aspects of the community, such as the website, bots, and other tools.

## Projects

- [Website](https://github.com/NLLCommunity/nllcommunity.github.io) - NLL's website.
- [Norsk-bott](https://github.com/NLLCommunity/discord-norsk-bott) - A Discord bot for the NLL Discord server.

> We also have several other projects on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/NorwegianLanguageLearning).
